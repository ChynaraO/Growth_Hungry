    /*
    1. Payment System (Interface)
Requirements:
●
●
●
Create an interface Payable:
void pay(double amount);
Implement two classes:
○
CreditCardPayment
○
CashPayment
Each should print a custom message in pay() indicating how the payment is
processed.
Bonus:
●
●
●
Write a method that takes a Payable[] and charges each one a random amount
between $1–100.
Demonstrate how the same method can call pay() on all types using polymorphism.
Add a refund(double amount) method to the interface. Think about how
CreditCardPayment and CashPayment would behave differently.
